# Pocket-Project

Before you get started make sure you are in the proper branch, use the command `git branch` to see the current branch
to switch the designed branch use `git checkout BRANCH_NAME`.

If new changes have been added to the `main` branch before you start working try doing `git fetch` on your terminal 
to get the most recent version of the code without having to worry about loosing any previous code done.

Try not to use the `main` branch at least that part of there project is complete.

Important to network with your collaborator to have a better coding experience and workflow.
