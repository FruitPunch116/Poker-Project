# Pocket-Project

Before you get started make sure you are in the proper branch, use the command `git branch` to see the current branch
to switch the designed branch use `git checkout BRANCH_NAME`.

To get your data into the remote branch use `git add` to uppload the files, use `git commit -m` 
to breavely explain the changes made, then `git push` to stage the changes created.

If new changes have been added to the `main` branch before you start working try doing `git fetch` on your withing the `main` branch 
inside your terminal to get the most recent version of the code without having to worry about loosing any previous code done.

Use `git pull` to get the branch information.

The command `git checkout origin/BRANCH_NAME -- FILE-NAME` is used to get information or files from a dessired branch.

To get the code on the `main` branch make sure you do checkout to the `main` then  do `git merge BRANCH_NAME` and finally use `git push` 
to upload into production.

Try not to use the `main` branch at least that part of there project is complete.

Important to network with your collaborator to have a better coding experience and workflow.
